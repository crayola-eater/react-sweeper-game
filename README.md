# Purpose
- A Zombie Sweeper game where the aim is to reveal all non-zombie squares and flag all zombie squares. (Similar to other sweeper games.)

# How to run
- Install Node.js (if not already installed)
- Clone this repo
- `cd` into `react-sweeper-game` directory and then `npm i`
- `npm start` to run the game locally

# Other commands
- `npm run build` to build locally
- `npm test` to run tests

# Tools used
- Core application
  - React (via Create React App)
  - Styled Components
  - HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- Testing (to be added)
  - Jest
  - React testing library

# What I learned
- Practiced expressing and encapsulating business logic within custom hooks.
- Practiced keeping components lean and presentational.
- Used `styled-components` for the first time. Learned its API and how we can apply styles conditionally based on props. Found it be really useful and flexible library that provides an ergonomic, positive developer experience.

# Things to add
- Provide an option for `difficulty`, which allows the user to play a hard game (on a bigger board with more zombies).
- Research/explore "themes" for `styled-components`, so that app-wide styling rulesets can be declared in one place and then reused wherever needed.
